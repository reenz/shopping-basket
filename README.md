# MMT Digital Front-end Test

### User Stories

*Basket-001*  
**As a** user  
**I want** to view my current basket  
**So that** I can see what I've added  

**Given** I am on the basket page  
**When** I view the page  
**Then** I can see all added items and their cost  

### Approach

* I have decided to build this basket using React as it is prefered by MMT over jquery. 
* I have never used react before so first I decided to make practice app [learn-react](https://github.com/reenz/learn-react ) the TDD style to get the hang of it. While doing pratice app I faced some issues like running the tests and running the server which was not addressed in the tutorial so googled it and manged to make small 'Hello World' react app.
* I will take first first two user stories to get started.

### Test Dependencies
* jest ,babel-jest, babel-preset-env, babel-preset-react,react-test-renderer,enzyme ,enzyme-adapter-react-16
